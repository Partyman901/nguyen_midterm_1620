## Q1
    Git is a system that has a main function of version-control. This is used for tracking changes in a big software development project and is very useful when multiple programmers are working on one project. 
    GitHub is a remote cloud service that lets you manage git repos remotely. This way, many developers can work on the same project from remote locations. It also offers an interface so you can better manage your repos. 
    Git and GitHub is different because git is a system for version-control while GitHub is a cloud service that lets you manage your Git repositories.

## Q2
    A branch in Git can be comparable to a tree in a sense that it is a path of development that is away from the main project. A branch can be defined as a snapshot of changes that is not added to the main project just yet. A branch can be created by using the command "$ git branch branchname". You would commonly use branches to make any changes to a project while not touching the main branch.

## Q6
    Http headers carry info like what type of client sent the request, server configuration, time and date of request, duration of data storage, data format, and tracking cookies. Used to sent info between the user and server. Three examples of HTTP header fields: General-header, response header, and request header. General headers are used for general request and response messages depending on the situation. Response headers are only used for response messages and does not relate to the message content. Request headers are only used for requests and does not relate to the message content.

## Q7
    The box model a set of rules that defines the elements size, position, and space. From inside out, the box model parts are content, padding, border, and margin.

## Q8
    4 CSS combinator selector include: descendant selector, child selector, adjacent sibling selector, and general sibling selector. The descendent selector (space) selects the element that is a descendent of another element. An example of this would be "p a" which would select the link inside the paragraph. The child selector (>) selects all elements that are the children of another element. An example of this would be "article > p" which would select the any paragraph that are children of the article. The adjacent sibling selector (+) select the sibling of an element. For example, "h1 + p" would select the paragraph that is after the heading. The general sibling selector (~) selects any elements that are siblings of an element. For example, "h1 ~ p" would select any paragraphs that the siblings of the heading.

## Q9
    Yes because in order to make the paragraphs appear side by side, we would have to use the float element.

## Q10
    Error 1: The title element inside link element whould be inside the head tags instead. The title element is used to identify a website on a webpage's tab or title bar and would not be used in this context.

    Error 2: http://bcit.ca needs a subdomain otherwise the browser will have to guess which subdomain to use which can lead to an entirely different website.
